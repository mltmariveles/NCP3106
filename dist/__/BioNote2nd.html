                there are things that I want to see and to know, but the shackles of time and reality is holding is
                grounding me in the place I was born, forever. But in this rock I yet to discover what it has to offer,
                what are the mysteries that it holds. In the short time that I am placed in this tiny rock, I have
                experienced a fraction of what is out here. I am an empty vessel that still has a lot more to store,
                when I was a human who still needed guidance in making decisions, I was care free and felt the
                rock was built for me and me alone that I am in the center of the universe but in reality I am a
                grain of sand on a beach, that is why I am trying hard to achieve.
